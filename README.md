Empathetic Code Reviewer ðŸ¤–ðŸ’™
An AI-powered tool that transforms critical code review feedback into constructive, educational, and empathetic guidance for developers.

Overview
The Empathetic Code Reviewer addresses a common challenge in software development: code reviews often become sources of friction due to blunt or impersonal feedback. This tool uses Google's Gemini AI to rephrase critical comments into supportive, educational guidance that helps developers understand the "why" behind suggestions, not just the "what".

Features
Empathetic Rephrasing: Converts direct criticism into constructive feedback

Educational Explanations: Provides clear explanations of software principles

Code Examples: Offers concrete improvements with working code snippets

Severity-Based Tone Adjustment: Adapts feedback tone based on comment harshness

Language Detection: Automatically identifies programming languages

Resource Linking: Provides relevant external documentation links

Holistic Summaries: Delivers encouraging overall feedback

Installation
1 Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/empathetic-code-reviewer.git
cd empathetic-code-reviewer

2 Install dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

3 Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory

Add your Gemini API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent

Usage
Basic Usage
Run the program and input your JSON when prompted:
python empathetic_reviewer.py

Input Format
Provide input as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "code_snippet": "def example_function():\n    pass",
  "review_comments": [

    "Comment 2"
  ]
}

Output
The program generates a comprehensive Markdown report with:

Original code snippet

Analysis of each review comment

Positive rephrasing of feedback

Explanation of software principles

Suggested code improvements

Relevant resource links

Overall encouraging summary

API Requirements
